Exercise 1.

if (x > 0) {
    if (x < 10) {
        System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
    }
}
It should read:  
if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
  System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
}

if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
        System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
    }
}

Exercise 2-
1- Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the second time zoop is invoked.
clink
zoop
clink
ping
zoop
main

This is the answer for number 2 in Exercise 5.12
The Complete output is:
just for
any not more
It's breakfast
!
2- What is the complete output? - see Exercise file



    public static void zoop(String fred, int bob) {
        System.out.println(fred);
        if (bob == 5) {
            ping("not ");
        } else {
            System.out.println("!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int bizz = 5;
        int buzz = 2;
        zoop("just for", bizz);
        clink(2 * buzz);
    }

    public static void clink(int fork) {
        System.out.print("It's ");
        zoop("breakfast ", fork);
    }

    public static void ping(String strangStrung) {
        System.out.println("any " + strangStrung + "more ");
    }

}

/*Exercise 3  
Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program in Section 5.8 after main invokes nLines with the parameter n == 4, just before the last invocation of nLines returns.


Exercise 5  
The purpose of this exercise is to take a problem and break it into smaller problems, and to solve the smaller problems by writing simple methods. Consider the first verse of the song “99 Bottles of Beer”:

99 bottles of beer on the wall,
99 bottles of beer,
ya’ take one down, ya’ pass it around,
98 bottles of beer on the wall.
Subsequent verses are identical except that the number of bottles gets smaller by one in each verse, until the last verse:

No bottles of beer on the wall,
no bottles of beer,
ya’ can’t take one down, ya’ can’t pass it around,
’cause there are no more bottles of beer on the wall!
And then the song (finally) ends.

Write a program that displays the entire lyrics of “99 Bottles of Beer”. Your program should include a recursive method that does the hard part, but you might want to write additional methods to separate other parts of the program. As you develop your code, test it with a small number of verses, like 3.*/
