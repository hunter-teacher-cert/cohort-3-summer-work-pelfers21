Blueprint for the Arts:  Digital Media

Vocabulary:  Social Justice, Social Injustice, Algorithms, Loops, Conditional Statements

Goals of the unit:
SWBAT:  Identify the historical/cultural roots of yarn art including: macrame, knitting, crocheting, weaving and other related types.
SWBAT: Create valuable ways to use Yarn to display themes of social injustice and/or to promote social justice.
SWBAT:  Relate to yarn art as it pertains to their culture/community
SWBAT:  Develop algorithms, using conditionals and loops to create a CS pattern for crochet in CSDT.org to demonstrate that yarn art follows algorithms.

Gholdy Muhammad’s Framework
Identity: How do I present myself to myself or others? 
Skills: Interpreting text for information on historical evidence of yarn art and using CS to create patterns of design using algorithms, loops, conditionals
Intellectualism: Students will be able to design a social justice theme through the use of organized knitting/crocheting or other organized yarn art group within class.
Criticality: Students will use this social justice idea within the school to help organize a “Yarn Bomb” to make social awareness to their topic of social justice they chose.
Joy: Students will learn that being dedicated to a cause and to spread awareness to others can help them feel the best about themselves. 
CS: Students will first use the tutorials in CSDT.org to create either knitting or crocheting patterns using algorithms, loops, conditionals, etc, to create either a square or circular pattern and then try creating their own pattern with additional programs such as Scratch, or other methods.


Lesson One:  History of Yarn Art including:  Crochet and Knitting 

Do Now: Think/Write/Pair/Share: What is Yarn Art and what experience do you have with yarn, wool or knitted material?
History of Knitting a Resource Guide 
Crochet Through History 
(Jig Saw Activity-Divide Article Up By Sections both articles) Students will read the article in groups and highlight the historical facts in their section assigned, related to the development of knitting, where and when it’s noted in the article and what type of article of clothing or product was designed.
Some questions to ponder/answer:  Look at some of the pictures in each article of the products that were created and see if you can determine how Computer science can be used in conjunction with yarn art.  Other questions:  How was the first early knitting/crocheting done? What did they use to knit/crochet the fabric with?  What was the yarn made of?  Why did they knit/crochet?  What evidence was found to support the claim where they started? (Information will be filled in on the slide show template for their group.  Groups will share their findings on the slide show presentations they have created.

Slide Show Template We will use this template for each group to enter their findings in the article section they read.

Homework:  Interview a family member about what they know about knitting, crocheting or yarn art from their culture.  Write down some of the important details you find out so you can share with the class.  Note:  Any yarn art besides knitting and crocheting can be shared.  For example:  macrame, needlepoint, and other things that use yarn.

Lesson Two:  Yarn Art and Culture

Do Now: Discuss with your partner what you found out about your family’s knowledge of yarn art from your culture.  See what information you may have in common.  Share your results in a document.  We will be using some of this information at a later date.

Let’s take a look at some of the ways Computer Science can be related to yarn art.  What did you notice about the different patterns in each type of product that you viewed in your article or might have seen during your interview with a family member?  Jot down student responses on the slide show.

We are going to take a look at two different types of patterns on the CSDT web site here:  http://CSDT.org and here are the tutorials that we are going to pick to try and create a pattern that resembles knit (square pattern) or crochet (circular pattern) https://csdt.org/culture/yarnarts/tutorials.html (Teacher can create a classroom for students to enable them to save work.  Students will be asked to sign into the Classroom with a class code for their work.) Before beginning any tutorial, what elements of programming do you think you will be using to create these patterns? (Write elements on the board)  - algorithms, loops, conditionals, motion, etc. (Go to the tutorial and demonstrate how the blockly program resembles Scratch-students will have had previous experience in my class with using Scratch).  Model the steps for the students to peruse the program tutorial and then allow time for them to complete the project. Choice allowed for either square or circular pattern.  As students are going through the rest of their chosen tutorial, go around the room to see if they are able to navigate the program directions.  If students finish early, let them help others that may need help or come up with their own design using docs to create a plan for their coding pattern.
Closing/Share/Discuss: the knit and crochet patterns created in the tutorial.  Ask students to identify the elements used in their programs.  How can they use this to create their own unique pattern?  Student will be creating their own patterns in the programs in CSDT or they may use Scratch if desired.

Lesson 3 - Yarn Bombing and Social Justice

Do Now: Think/Write/Pair/Share with your partner:   How can we use Yarn Art to Create a statement about Social Injustice/Justice? (UN Sustainable Goals see below) Share Responses- Write on the slide show.

Let’s take a look at some pictures to see what you think they are trying to say in each.  Follow the pear deck at the link below and answer the question on the first slide for each image on each slide.  At the end of the images (7 of them)  there are two additional slides with questions. (10-15 minute activity- 20 Max)

We’ll review some of your responses to the images after we watch the video below.

Youtube video:  How yarn bombing grew into a worldwide movement | Magda Sayeg 

Questions for discussion for Yarn Bombing video:

What is yarn bombing and how did it start?

(The speaker in this video described how she accidentally started yarn bombing) - let students describe what she did.

How did yarn bombing spread across the world?

How do people use yard bombing? (self expression, social awareness, etc)

If you were to create some type of message using yarn bombing, what would you like the world to know?  How could you make social awareness about this topic?  Why is it important for us to be aware of your topic?  How can we make a Social Injustice into a Social Justice?

Look at some of the goals below from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  What topic interests you and how can you create a message about this topic using yarn bombing?  We will be creating a template in Computer Science program to help us with the planning of patterns we might want to use.


Homework:  Pick one of the topics and be prepared for our next class to have some information on your topic about the Social Injustice it describes.

Lesson Four:

Students will create a culminating project in several class sessions to include what they learned about Yarn Art, Yarn Bombing and Creating patterns for Yarn Art in CSDT.


Culminating Project Activity:

You will pick one of the topics and do some research on the topics to see what type of Social Injustices they face.  
You will see how you can use Yard Bombing to display your message.  What type of image would you create?  What type of design would you create in your CSDT pattern?  Would you use knit or would you use crochet?  
Once you have chosen your topic and type of image and pattern you would like to use, you will first go to the http://CSDT.org site and log into our class.  Create your pattern that you think you would like to try.  Remember, we are using the algorithms we learned in the tutorials in the program, as well as the conditional statements and the loops.
Students will share their work with classmates using Padlet for peer feedback.



Note to students:  For those that are actually interested in following through with their learning how to create a Yarn Craft with learning to crochet, knit, do needle art, or even make a sign with “yarn painting,” you can join us after school on Monday afternoons and we can get you started.
