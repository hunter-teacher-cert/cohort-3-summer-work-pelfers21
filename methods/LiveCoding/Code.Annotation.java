//CODE: This method should search through data and return the index of the first time value appears in data. If value is not in data return -1.


//(MAQ) what do we call this (method, class?)
//(MAQ) - what do you think line 20 is doing? 
//Provide (P) remember what() this means - inside these () parenthesis are the parameters - what are the paremeters on line 23?
//Wh
public int linearSearch(int value, ArrayList<Integer> data) {

  //happening? how is this line related to 19 above?
