# Methods Scaffolded Activities

### We decided on using JavaScript since we both teach this course using P5 in Middle School.

### We included three activities at different levels for learners that beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners.  The activities require students to code a traffic light by creating the shapes, and filling the appropriate colors for each traffic light when the mouse hovers in a specified area in the conditional statements on the canvas.  The basic level has a lot of the coding done already (shapes created, variables added, etc) with hints and simply asks the students to fill in the parameters for the if statement.  The second activity asks for the students to fill in the if statements and the variable colors for each traffic light.  The final project asks for the students to use the mouseX and mouseY location so that the lights will only light up if the actual circle area is hovered over.

## We found that scaffolding using skeleton coding with directions and hints will help the students complete each level.  We also consider these tiered assignments.
