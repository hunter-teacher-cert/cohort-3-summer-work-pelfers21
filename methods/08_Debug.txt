 Lesson on Debugging Strategy
Patti Elfers, Adam Prado, Richard Parker

Students will be given a program that is already created in Java.  The program we decided on is Index of Max (Prework7).  We will remove several items from Index of Max (Prework07). 

In order to debug the program, remove semicolons and a brace and have the students compile and check for errors in the console. Identify the lines that are generating the errors, troubleshoot, and correct.  Compile again to see if it works.  Once it is all correct then follow the next steps.

Have the students print the current max index through every iteration of the for loop.  Using the system print lines will also help check what the program is doing and gives them a better understanding for how to check the program flow, sort of like the stepping tool.

If students are working in pairs they can also check each others work.

Index Of Max Code
public class Exer04
{
  
public static int indexOfMax(int[] a)

{

// stoe the index of maximum element

int index = -1

// store the maximum value in the array

int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

int i;

for( i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++ )

//{

// if current element is greater the maximum element till now

if( a[i] > max )

{

max = a[i];

index = i;

}

}

return index;

}

public static void main(String[] args)

{

int[] arr = { 2 , 5 , 3 , 6 , -1}

int index = indexOfMax( arr );

System.out.println("Index of Maximum Element : " + index);

}
