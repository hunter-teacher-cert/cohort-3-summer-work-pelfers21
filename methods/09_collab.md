## Unit of Study: Scratch - Using Variables	Lesson 6th Grade

### Topic: Creating and Using Variables in Scratch

#### Standards addressed:

CCLS: RST 6-8:4 - Determine the meaning of symbols, key terms, and other domain specific words and phrases as they are used in a specific scientific or technical context relevant to grades 6-8 texts and topics.

#### Blueprint for the Arts: Digital Media

#### Skill: Creating and Using Variables in Scratch Block Programming	Academic 

#### Vocabulary: variable

#### Warm Up: (Pairing-collaboration) Think/Write/Pair/Share (First think a minute about the question, then write your response in your journal and then discuss with your partner what you both believe the answer to be) -  In your online journal/notebook answer the following question: Describe what a variable is and how you think they are used in Scratch? Then talk with your partner about your response and come to a consensus on your definition. Share with class.

#### Connection: (Review with Class)

#### We’ve been working on Scratch learning Block coding.  We have created sprites, learned how to make them move, and add backgrounds.

#### Today we will learn an additional concept in Scratch to create and use variables

#### We want to learn how to use variables with Scratch so we can enhance our programming abilities to change different things like sprites, movement, etc. in our programs.

#### Mini Lesson/Aim: How are variables used in Scratch? 

#### 1.	Using this program in Scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13309017/ demonstrate how this program is created as a teaching program with the comments as directions and demonstrate the variable for the first sprite with the students.  (The teacher demonstrates how the program will work for the first variable and how to follow the comments in the program.—If available, the comments and the program can be translated for ELL’s that need translation.
#### 2.	Quick Check:  Have students try to complete the second sprite’s directions.  Ask, what does this variable do?  Where should I put it?  What happens to the sprite when this variable is inserted.  How can I change the distance of the variable “howfartogo?”
#### 3.	Show students all of the sprites and after working through the first sprite script together, have students try the second one on their own, (5 minutes if needed)
#### 4.	ASSESS by checking each student’s monitor to see if they followed the directions given for the sprite and assist as needed to complete the task. (Observe student work by walking around the room checking their screens to see if they have been successful. Have students come up to the smartboard to demonstrate how they solved the problem by working in pairs.)

#### Work period: Grouping: Students will work at their own pace with their neighbor/partner (Several students have been purposefully seated for help with language translation and others are seated with those that have higher academic skills to help those with IEP’s or learning disabilities). Students are not aware of their differences at the beginning of the year about their ability levels, only the language differences groups are aware.

#### Task 1.Assessment:  Teacher walks around the room watching students demonstrate their coding for the second sprite.  Share the completed script for the code
#### Task 2:  If you are able to complete the second sprite, then move on to the third and fourth.
#### Task 3: For the fifth sprite, they are asking your to complete the program with your own variable.  Hint:  Look back at the other scripts from the four sprites.  How can you use what is there to complete the 5th sprite variable?
#### Here the students are able to work with their partner and benefit from talking though what they want to code and how to debug with their peer if needed.
#### Assessments/Questions: Students get instant feedback knowing if their code works or not by trying it out.   How might you be able to vary the speed, distance, value, etc that you have used as a variable? Next steps:  How did you create your own variable for the 5th sprite?  What “varied” in your script?
#### Share: Assessment/Question responses 

#### Closing/Exit Ticket:
#### In your online journal, answer:  Why is it important to use variables in coding?

#### Note on grouping:
Students are seated next to a partner with differing ability so the more experienced student can work with the less experienced student.  

#### Materials and Scaffolds used:  Computer, Internet, web pages: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13309017/  https://translate.google.com/ (for ELL students needing translation) Google Docs for their online journals. Note:  SWD’s Pacing is student centered due to individual variation within the grouping. ELL’s Scratch can be translated into just about any language within the program so that it makes the program somewhat universal.


### Responses to the Prompts 
(Knowledge of student ability level in Scratch is determined by an assessment that I adminster prior to the Unit)
For this lesson, the benefits of the paired group work is threefold.  One grouping is to help those new to the English language, have the benefit of a peer be able to translate for the.  The second grouping is good for students that have some learning disabilities.  They have the benefit of a peer that may have better reading ability to assist with explaining the tasks.  The third type of grouping is unintentional and allows for students to pair with their neighbor that sits near them to work together in a similar fashion.  Not all grouping works this work, but for this project it does.

#### A good assessment or “mechanism” to see how it’s working is to first observe as a teacher to see if the students are able to progress to the next sprite…There are five sprites/variables that have to be coded in this program.  Students will also be asked to answer questions about what the different sprites are doing when they follow the directions in the program.  Volunteers will be asked to share at the end of the class to demonstrate on the smartboard what they have completed.  Students will be given directions on how they will work with their partners through teacher directions and directions written on the board.  (Students are familiar with the Think Write Pair Share Method)

#### When groups are formed and students may seem reluctant to buy in to the organization, there is a reward system in place for those that are “compliant” with classroom rules and rituals.  If they demonstrate that they can “tolerate” their grouping they gain tickets.  Tickets can buy them a “missing assignment zero” be dropped.  Another method used is that those who believe are “Know it All’s”, I ask to be a class helper and help me go around the room to see who’s catching on and help those that are having difficulty.  But, they are also asked to complete a higher level task.  (Reverse psychology….often times they are reluctant and would rather stick with their group).

#### When all is said and done, the group work instructions are that students will work on their individual computers to be able to turn in their own work, however, they may collaborate on the project and it can be similar or the same provided they are both working on it.  For long term goals, I want the students to be able to work together on projects in pairs so that they can eventually work on a larger group project for Games for Change- a organization that has a Student Challenge.  They also need to be able to collaborate with others in the class for different group work.
