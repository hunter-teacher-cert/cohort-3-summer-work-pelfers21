Roster: Patti Elfers - Group Members: Saranii Muller, Adam Driggs, Christopher DeSilva

### Environment-All are related to School Community

* school size: 1700 students
* school grade range: 6-9
* faculty count: 120 teachers / 1 STEM and 1 CS teacher
* courses: LIST OF CS COURSES YOUR SCHOOL OFFERS
Incluced in the CS - curriculum are:  Scratch, Physical Computing -- Microbits, Lego Mindstorm Robotics, P5 - Processing, Python - Codesters, HTML/CSS - Code.org, Bootstrap Data Science
Included in the STEM curriculum are:  App Inventor, Scratch, P5 - Processing, Bootstrap Data Science

### Club|Organization|Initiative|System: 
NYC First Robotics

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* NYC First Robotics promotes team building and collaboration
* builds critical thinking skills
* builds computer science skills
  
#### Rollout Timeline
* Team/s can be built the first 6 weeks of school by recruiting for students.  Teams will begin to meet and discuss the various positions available on the team and make plans for registering team and fundraising.
* Milestones along the way would be:
* recruiting
* forming the team
* assigning positions
* registering the team
* arranging team meeting times and extra time when needed
* fundraising committee
* building the robot  
  
* coding the robot
* keeping track of the meetings in the journal
* documenting activities
* getting ready for competition
* working with high school for community connection

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?
Measuring success can be seen by:
* students cooperating
* robot being build
* coding taking place
* notebook/journal being created and updated
* purchases needed able to be made from fundraising
* student success at competitions

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* student absences--need to set rules for missing meetings
* student morale low when loss occurs-students need to learn that participating is the goal and having a working coded-robot is in itself successful
* coding difficulties - bring in help to work on coding from former students
* building the robot to student specification not always possible, need to take shortcuts

## Club|Organization|Initiative|System: 
Creating Parent Interest in CS Through Parent Engagement

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* Parent Coding Night will promote Parent interest and understanding of CS
* It will help Parents to gain insight into their children's interest's in computing, coding and gaming
* promote good family time
  
  #### Rollout Timeline
* Interest forms can be sent out during the first few weeks of school through the Parent Coordinator after their first PTA meeting.
* Plans can be made to create a PTA meeting/Coding Evening
* If successful, we can plan for addtional follow up ones monthly.
* Plans can also be made to have virtual meetups.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?
Measuring success can be seen by:
* Parent interest in the survey sent out by the Parent Coordinator
* Parental attendance at the meetings
* Parents being successul in learning some code by creating projects

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Parents signing up and not showing up
* Timing of meetings might need to be changed
* Virtual meetups might be easier for timing purposes
* Weekends might be better planning times for some

## Club|Organization|Initiative|System: School-wide Hackathon (Hack League) and include parents/siblings/teachers


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
*will help build CS interest throughout the school community
* all students in the school are invited--no coding experience needed
* different ages/grade levels work together and make new friends
* Parents working with children and other parents
* Other teachers working with teams
* 
  
  #### Rollout Timeline
* planning time is about 4-6 weeks
* need to create a form and advertise around the school
* use of Mouse Squad to spread the word
* Use of school web site to advertise
* Collecting of registrants in the Google Form
* Theme for the Event - Problem the students/parents/teachers have to solve
* Prizes
* Tee-shirts
* Lunches
#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?
Measuring success can be seen by:
* if interest is there, there will be questions posed to the Parent Coordinator and/or the teacher/organizer
* The Google Form will be filled out with enough participants
* Questions will be posed about the event to those organizing

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Parents signing up and not showing up
* Teachers volunteering and not showing up
* Students not showing up
* Possibility of money not available for prizes, lunches, or tee shirts (incentives)
* Not having enough registrants for the event
