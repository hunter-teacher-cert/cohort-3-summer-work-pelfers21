## CS Standards:
7-8.CT.1

## Vocabulary
* Conditionals (if/if-else/if-else if-else)
* Syntax
* Semicolon ;
* Curly braces {}
* Parentheses ()
  
## Do Now 
Think/Write Pair Share:  Write a condtional statement that uses and if, else if, and else.  How do you use proper syntax?

[1 student from each pair/group shares out at end.]

### Intro: 
Reminder of syntax from Do Now & state focus of lesson: practicing syntax for conditional statements.  

[If needed, review Jamboard norms - work together on task.  For some groups, roles like driver/navigator may be needed.]

Walk students through the if conditional example on slide 1, noting English phrase, p5 syntax, and how the sticky notes are arranged to show the syntax. Make sure to also note that students can't alter this slide so it can serve as a good reference if needed.

[If needed, direct students to slide 5 to practice before reviewing slides 2-3.]

Similarly, walk students through the if-else and if-else if-else conditional examples on slides 2 & 3.  Note the color coding of text and sticky notes.

After reviewing directions on slide 4, ask students what they can do if they are stuck. Make sure students know they can use slides 1-3 as a resource.

Observe students working on all practice slides.


Early finishers can try out the 2nd practice examples for each type in p5 code.  


## Quick Check/Formative Assessment
Look at practice exercises from Jamboard: have they completed both if exercises?  Both if-else?  Are there any common issues?  

## Work Period
1 class period

## Task/s
Complete the Jamboard activity to reinforce if, if else, else statements

## Closing: Exit Ticket
Have students write down an english language conditional and code version on a 3x5 card
